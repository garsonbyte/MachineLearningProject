# Wine & Quality Type Predictor
## Abstract: 
Roughly 60% of Americans claim to enjoy an occasional glass of wine, whether itâ€™sat a special dinner or at home.  Two of the most popular wines are red wine andwhite wine, which more than 60% of wine consumers drink.
Both  red  and  white  wines,  while  strikingly  different  in  appearance,  have  similar distributions of pH, sulfuric oxides, chlorides, and other elements.  The goal of our project is to apply machine learning algorithms to correctly classify a red or white wine sample and to predict wine quality.  A dataset provided by UCI was used for our statistical analyses.  Preliminary steps included preprocessing the data into the desired  form,  and  then  applying,  PCA  (Principal  Component  Analysis),  an  unsupervised learning algorithm to find trends in our unstructured data.  Afterwards, we implemented three supervised learning algorithms (Polynomial Regression, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines) to test the accuracy of the predicted results.
Another  goal  of  our  project  was  to  illustrate  the  effect  of  regularization  and  feature  transformation  on  our  data.   Lasso  (L1)  and  Ridge  (L2)  regularization  were applied  to  the  linear  and  logistic  regression  models.   Three  different  kernels  were used and compared within our SVM model.
